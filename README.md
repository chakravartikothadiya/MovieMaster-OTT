# MovieMaster-OTT

MovieMaster
Project Description:
MovieMaster is an OTT platform hosting movies of various genres for a wide audience. Why 
should you choose our platform over Netflix or Prime? We offer many user interactivities that 
these platforms don't have, such as a comment section and chatrooms dedicated to movies, to 
discuss various plots or movie arcs with wild fans like you, as we promote fan 
theories! Additionally, we will recommend our users with movies according to genre page 
they are in, using a recommendation engine, so that our user can deeply emerge in triller, 
fantasy, romance or any genre they love with nonstop related movies.
Moreover, our platform is a safe place. With Firebase authentication, your account is secure 
from potential breaches.

## Course Technologies:
## React
We will use React as the front-end framework for the single page application.
## Firebase
Firebase authentication will be used to authorize users for our website. It will 
include login/signup by email id, Google, and Facebook.
## Socket.io
We will use Socket.io to create a chat room for each movie where users can 
communicate in real-time using the full-duplex communication that Socket.io allows.

## Independent Technologies:
## ML/Flask (Python)
We will deploy Content-based Recommender Engine, which will 
recommend user with the similar movies, based on genre. We will use flask framework to 
deploy the Recommender Engine and create an API to fetch the list of the recommended 
movies.
## DigitalOcean
We will deploy our project on digital ocean, using many of the resources 
provided by the platform
